<p id="lista1">Medical Products Laboratories, Inc. (MPL) is a leading full-service human and veterinary pharmaceutical contract manufacturing and packaging company which provides an array of services to its US- and international-based clients. Having served the industry since 1928, MPL has established an excellent reputation and is recognized as a full service provider to the pharmaceutical industry. MPL can turn today’s complex pharmaceutical development process into a practical, economical, and manageable experience through its professional expertise and project management services. From the initial development of a pharmaceutical formulation through scale-up of the pilot and commercial phases, MPL’s regulatory and compliance teams will guide you through the latest FDA regulations while the business teams work to keep the project on time and on budget.
MPL dedicates resources to monitoring the constantly changing FDA guidelines, helps its clients understand the regulations relevant to their products, and apply them rationally and practically. The pharmaceuticals MPL produces meet cGXP compliance standards, and our quality management systems have adopted the principals of ISO 9000 & 13485.

</ul>
<p id="lista2">Medical Products Laboratories, Inc. (MPL) is one of the leading full-service veterinary medicine and products contract manufacturers and packagers in the U.S.
Veterinary cosmetic product development and formulation is subject to a similar range of regulatory approvals and requirements, and as an experienced veterinary products manufacturer, MPL offers the wide range of capabilities necessary for both veterinary cosmetic contract manufacturing and veterinary medicine manufacturing. While veterinary cosmetics are widely used for a variety of applications, and can be delivered in a number of different formats, it is important that all products meet strict guidelines for safe use to ensure that both the animals and those applying these products are out of harm’s way. MPL streamlines the clearance and approval process for FDA certification, and helps customers understand the regulations that apply to their particular veterinary cosmetic product development and formulation process.
In addition to the regulatory expertise required for high quality veterinary cosmetic contract manufacturing, MPL possesses all of the advanced capabilities necessary, from the initial development through the scale-up of pilot and commercial phases.
Veterinary Medicine and Products Manufacturers
MPL is a non-sterile facility that maintains an extensive environmental monitoring program, with manufacturing suites filtered and pressurized for state-of-the-art environmental controls. Because de-ionized water is at the core of manufacturing pharmaceuticals, it is one of most important raw materials in veterinary cosmetic product development and formulations as well. Duplicate DI water systems feature an on-demand supply with online Total Organic Carbon detection. MPL manufactures all types of animal drug products including ANADA, prescription, and OTC, in dosage forms that vary from liquids to semi-solids to solids.</p>

Our FDA-certified facility is prepared to conduct any type of medical manufacturing and packaging project, including dietary supplements, veterinary products, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and more. Offering the most diverse and professional range of services for medical manufacturing and packaging available, MPL combines the capability to test, manufacture, format, package, and deliver products that meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements for dosage precision, consistency, and safety.
